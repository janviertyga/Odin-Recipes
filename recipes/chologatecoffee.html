    <h3>There are several ways to create chocolate coffee</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mocha: A classic example of chocolate coffee is the mocha. It is made by combining espresso or strong brewed coffee with steamed milk and chocolate syrup or melted chocolate. The chocolate adds sweetness and a rich, creamy texture to the coffee.</li>
        <li>Hot Chocolate with Coffee: Another variation is to mix hot chocolate with a shot of espresso or strong coffee. This creates a delicious blend of chocolate and coffee flavors in a comforting, warm drink.</li>
        <li>Chocolate Coffee Additives: Some people prefer to add chocolate-flavored additives, such as cocoa powder or chocolate shavings, directly into their brewed coffee. This method allows for customization based on personal preference, allowing you to adjust the chocolate intensity.</li>
        <li>Flavored Coffee Beans: Another option is to use coffee beans that are infused with chocolate flavors during the roasting process. These beans provide a distinct chocolate undertone to the brewed coffee, resulting in a naturally infused chocolate coffee experience.</li>
